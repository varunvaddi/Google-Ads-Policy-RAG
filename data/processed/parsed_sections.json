    "content": "The following is not allowed:\n\nSharing\n\npersonally identifiable information (PII)\n\nwith Google through remarketing tags, conversion tracking tags, or through any product data feeds that might be associated with ads\n\nExample (non-exhaustive)\n\n: Sharing user’s email addresses through URLs that have remarketing tags\n\nNote\n\n: This requirement does not apply to Google Ads services subject to the\n\nGoogle Ads Data Processing Terms\n\n. (Enhanced Conversions, Google Ads Customer Match, Google Ads Store sales, Google Ads Store sales (direct upload))\n\nTroubleshooter: Unacceptable information sharing\n\nIdentify the source\n\n. Use the breach notice email provided by Google to identify which URLs are violating the policy. Frequently, PII is accidentally included in URLs that are passed to Google from web forms, login pages, and custom email marketing campaign parameters.\n\nRemove PII in shared data\n\n. Update your systems so that PII is not included in URLs. Below are the most common methods for removing PII from URLs.\n\nWeb forms\n\n: HTML forms should be submitted with the\n\nPOST\n\nprotocol. If the\n\nGET\n\nprotocol is used, the parameters of the form will end up as part of the URL in the address bar. Update the page source or the component generating the HTML so the form tag has\n\nmethod=”post”\n\nin the attribute.\n\nLearn more about the form method\n\n.\n\nLogin pages\n\n: Some sites, especially those with user profiles or user login, use URL patterns that include PII as part of the design. Replace the PII in the URL with a unique site-specific identifier or a unique user ID (UUID).\n\nCustom email marketing campaign parameters\n\n: Examine the URLs generated by a test email marketing campaign to identify email addresses or other PII in URL parameters. Assign each user a unique site-specific identifier or a unique user ID (UUID) and track the UUID through URL parameters.\n\nYou can implement a UUID to prevent PII from passing to Google. For example,\n\nsite.com/my_settings/sample@email.com\n\ncould be changed to\n\nsite.com/my_settings/43231\n\n, where\n\n43231\n\nis a number that uniquely identifies the account with address sample@email.com.\n\nFill out the\n\nresponse form\n\n. Use the form to indicate that you have taken steps to fix the issue. The form helps Google know where you are in the process.\n\nVerify the problem is fixed\n\n. After you respond through the form, Google will validate that the changes you made to your site addressed the issue. Within two weeks, you’ll receive another notice to confirm that the issue is fixed or let you know if PII is still being shared from URLs associated with your account. If PII is still detected, examine the updated list of URLs that don’t comply with the policy to determine the cause of the issue.\n\nNote that you can verify that your changes work on a test site before pushing code changes to your live site. Tag your test site with tags from the same Google Ads customer ID that you use for personalized advertising. Once your test site shows up in the list of URLs where PII was detected, you can make test changes. If we stop detecting PII from your test site, it will drop off reports. Then you can push changes to your live site.\n\nRemarketing lists and other lists based on remarketing, such as\n\ncustom combination lists\n\nor\n\nsimilar audiences\n\n, will be disabled if they don’t comply with this policy.
