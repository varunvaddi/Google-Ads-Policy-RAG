We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network.</p>\n<p>Google requires that advertisers comply with all <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6023676\">applicable laws and regulations</a> and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us.</p>\n<p><a id=\"398\" name=\"398\"></a>Advertisers have a responsibility not to promote content or engage in behavior that risks harm to our users, employees, or the Ads ecosystem. If we see such content or behavior, we may take action, including but not limited to restricting or blocking your ads or suspending your account.</p>\n<div class=\"no-margin\"><h2>Need help?</h2>\n<p>If you have questions about our policies, review the policy guidelines and examples provided or <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/gethelp\" rel=\"noopener\">contact Google Ads Support</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"no-margin\">Rate how helpful this page is and share your feedback with us below:</div>\n<div class=\"no-margin\"></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></section> <div class=\"sub-article-container shaded\"> <div class=\"article-survey-container\" data-stats-id=\"6008942\" data-stats-ve=\"20\" data-stats-visible-imp=\"\" id=\"article-survey-container\"> <div class=\"as\"><h2 class=\"title\" tabindex=\"-1\">Was this helpful?</h2><div class=\"how-improve\">How can we improve it?</div><div class=\"button-group\"><button aria-label=\"Yes (Was this helpful?)\" class=\"as-button\" data-value=\"5\" title=\"Yes\" type=\"button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g clip-path=\"url(#clip0_6940_5794)\"><path d=\"M18 21H7V8L14 0.999999L15.25 2.25C15.3667 2.36667 15.4583 2.525 15.525 2.725C15.6083 2.925 15.65 3.11667 15.65 3.3V3.65L14.55 8H21C21.5333 8 22 8.2 22.4 8.6C22.8 9 23 9.46667 23 10V12C23 12.1167 22.9833 12.2417 22.95 12.375C22.9167 12.5083 22.8833 12.6333 22.85 12.75L19.85 19.8C19.7 20.1333 19.45 20.4167 19.1 20.65C18.75 20.8833 18.3833 21 18 21ZM9 19H18L21 12V10H12L13.35 4.5L9 8.85V19ZM9 8.85V10V12V19V8.85ZM7 8V10H4V19H7V21H2V8H7Z\" fill=\"#4C4D50\"></path></g><defs><clippath id=\"clip0_6940_5794\"><rect fill=\"white\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\"></rect></clippath></defs></svg></button><button aria-label=\"No (Was this helpful?)\" class=\"as-button\" data-value=\"1\" title=\"No\" type=\"button\"><svg viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g clip-path=\"url(#clip0_6940_5797)\"><path d=\"M6 3H17V16L10 23L8.75 21.75C8.63333 21.6333 8.53333 21.475 8.45 21.275C8.38333 21.075 8.35 20.8833 8.35 20.7V20.35L9.45 16H3C2.46667 16 2 15.8 1.6 15.4C1.2 15 1 14.5333 1 14V12C1 11.8833 1.01667 11.7583 1.05 11.625C1.08333 11.4917 1.11667 11.3667 1.15 11.25L4.15 4.2C4.3 3.86667 4.55 3.58333 4.9 3.35C5.25 3.11667 5.61667 3 6 3ZM15 5H6L3 12V14H12L10.65 19.5L15 15.15V5ZM15 15.15V14V12V5V15.15ZM17 16V14H20V5H17V3H22V16H17Z\" fill=\"#4C4D50\"></path></g><defs><clippath id=\"clip0_6940_5797\"><rect fill=\"white\" height=\"24\" width=\"24\"></rect></clippath></defs></svg></button></div><form data-revision=\"5\" data-stats-ve=\"20\"><div class=\"field\"><textarea aria-label=\"Sorry about that, How can we improve it?\" name=\"article_feedback_comment\"></textarea></div><button class=\"submit-button\" type=\"button\">Submit<div class=\"submit-button-target\"></div></button></form></div> </div> </div> </article>",
